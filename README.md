### C++ code I wrote for a graphical user interface of a fast line detection computer vision algorithm (see the PLIME folder) developed in the lab of Daniel Mlynek, PhD at the EPFL during my work on the efficient detection and tracking of primitive shapes (lines, circles and ellipses), which is of great interest to the computer vision community - in particular, in the context of the analysis of multiple circles and ellipses, for which satisfactory solutions need yet to be found.
