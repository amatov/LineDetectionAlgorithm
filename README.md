### The Visual C++ code I wrote in 2001 for graphical user interface of a fast line detection computer vision software based on combinatorial optimization algorithms estimating piecewise linear models (see PLIME folder) developed in the lab of Daniel Mlynek, PhD "Fast Line Detection Algorithms Based on Combinatorial Optimization. 2001"
