### C++ code I wrote for a graphical user interface of a fast line detection computer vision algorithm (see the PLIME folder) developed in the lab of Daniel Mlynek, PhD at the EPFL. The efficient detection and tracking of primitive shapes (lines, circles and ellipses) has a great interest in computer vision, particularly for analysis of multiple circles and ellipses for which satisfactory solutions need yet to be found.
